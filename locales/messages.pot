"So, you're going to install Linux. But are you familiar with Linux?\n"
"\n"
"If not, there are some resources to help you master it without too much "

"- Git for Windows -- includes bash and core command-line utilities, as well "

"- VirtualBox -- you'll be able to install and play with any Linux "
"distribution you like in a sandbox.\n"
"- LiveCD -- you'll be able to boot into Linux and at least check if your "
"hardware works.\n"
"\n"
"The most common question is 'What distribution should I use?'\n"
"Well, I'd recommend Ubuntu or Fedora to have a pleasant start.\n"
"\n"
"The next question is 'What desktop environment should I use?'\n"
"I'd recommend Gnome if you have enough memory or XFCE, if you don't. :)\n"

"Here are some links (all of them include LiveCDs, by the way):\n"
